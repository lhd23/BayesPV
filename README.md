This code implements the Bayesian hierarchical model described in the paper
*L. Dam, "A probabilistic framework for cosmological inference from peculiar velocities"*, [`arxiv:2002.05898`](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05898/).

Some of the results of this paper make use of Fundamental Plane data from the 6 Degree Field Galaxy Survey. This can be found in
the Supplementary data section of [Campbell et al. (2014)](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stu1198).
